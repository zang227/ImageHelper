# Intro
Image Helper is a program used to aid in the sorting of images on your desktop.

# How to use

ImageHelper may be used for both single and multidirectory image sorting

## Single Directory Use

Single Directory instructions are for a single directory containing images.


First simply click on the textbox next to the Load Directory button and then find and open the directory containing the images you would like to sort, and click the Load Directory Button.

You will also need to specifiy which directory or directories you would like to move the images to by using the textboxes by any of the move image buttons which work the same way was the Load Directory Textbox.

Clicking the corresponding Move Directory button will move the image to the directory specified in the text box.

You can go through the directory without moving images by using the Next and Back buttons at the top.

Some image metadata, as well as the amount of images left in the directory and your position in the directory is located underneath the move buttons.

## Multi Directory Use

Multi directory instructions are for directories containing directories containing images.
**Note that this assumes all child directories of the parent have images within them and will not look any deeper. The structure is Parent -> Child -> Image.**

Start by clicking the Load Directories button and selecting the parent directory containing the child directories. Once selected the program will automatically load the first directory and the first directory's first image. You'll also want to set where you want to move your images to.

If you chose you may also set where youd like to move the loaded directory by clicking the textboxt next to Move Directory. This is optional. Should you have chosen to do this clicking the Move Directory button will move the directory to the directory of your choosing.

You may move within the parent directory using the Previous and Next Directory buttons. The program will automatically load the next or previous directory for you.

# Other Features

## Scaling

By default image scaling is turned off, but you can also scale images using the scale image button. If scaling is turned off and the image is too large, you can use the scroll bars to pan the image.
